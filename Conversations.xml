                Traveler, I shall not hear ye; circumstances make me weary,
                So begone unless you have a treatment for my heart so sore.
                Once my heart was light and floating, like a firefly emoting,
                dancing with the motes that lit the outside of my study door.
                Once I danced among the motes all floating past my study door;
                Now my spirit will not soar.

            <text Priority="1">
                What is that you come here bearing? You who zip about wayfaring,
                Have you brought the means to heal my heart the way it was before?
                Please O Stranger, I beseech you, may my low entreaty reach you,
                Grant me that small mote of light you carry, this I ask you for!
                I'll be grateful evermore.
